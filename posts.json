    "content": "\n      \n        <div class=\"content-inner\">\n<p id=\"7b0b\">If you have an app idea, you need to test if it will actually be accepted by your core audience. This is called app validation. It’s a way to find out whether the app idea is able to get the kind of traction you want. You certainly don’t want all the hard labor and monetary investment that you put into your app to go to waste. While there is no guarantee of how popular your app will be, there are ways to test its viability to the public by carrying out some simple but effective exercises.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ca98\">Why validate your app idea?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" data-src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/300/1*PvPkfqh7uqmLwMdhyBpDOA.png\" class=\" lazyloading\" src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/300/1*PvPkfqh7uqmLwMdhyBpDOA.png\"><noscript><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/300/1*PvPkfqh7uqmLwMdhyBpDOA.png\" alt=\"\"/></noscript></figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"9873\">There are around 50,000 new apps added to the Apple App Store every single month. Validation is required in order to find out whether your app will resonate with your audience. Nearly £40,000 to £500,000 is spent on building any given app. As a result, validation is incredibly important to make sure you don’t overspend and blow out your resources before you’ve proven how effective your app can be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"cdc1\"><strong>Let’s look at the steps you can take to validate your app idea. It’s important to do these in order where we’ll be looking outside of the app stores (Apple App Store and Google Play Store) and inside of the app stores.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"2bf5\"><strong>Step 1. Search outside app stores</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" data-src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/300/1*PAbPQugQxEG8gE_gSEzG7A.png\" class=\" lazyloading\" src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/300/1*PAbPQugQxEG8gE_gSEzG7A.png\"><noscript><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/300/1*PAbPQugQxEG8gE_gSEzG7A.png\" alt=\"\"/></noscript></figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"6bd7\">First, you want to look outside the app stores for validation for your app. Start by looking for startups on platforms like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://angel.co/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Wellfound</a>&nbsp;and check daily posts on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Product Hunt</a>&nbsp;for the latest ideas and trends coming out. This will allow you to gauge what the most popular ideas are and whether your app can fit in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"9896\">In addition, follow the news and various reports about what is being funded. Look at angel investors, hedge funds, funding organisations, and reports from various newspapers about the newest ideas being funded around the world. VCs and accelerators, as well as, startup leaders share their thoughts on websites, social media handles, blogs, etc, about what their next business ventures are and what they’re looking to fund. The same type of information can be taken from investor portfolio pages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"651d\">If your app idea is similar to those trending, being funded, or in the same industry, then that’s a great start and shows there is some validation in your idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"2c4a\"><strong>Step 2. Analyse existing apps</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" data-src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/300/1*MqK874Ec3t5SMe1EoAj91Q.png\" class=\"lazyload\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/300/1*MqK874Ec3t5SMe1EoAj91Q.png\" alt=\"\"/></noscript></figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"5b55\">The next step is where we look in the app stores to identify apps specifically, rather than general business ideas, that are similar to yours and see how they are doing:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"54e1\">Find out if your competitors are in the top download charts.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"cb92\">If they’re in the top grossing charts and are consistently ranking very high, find out where they’re featuring and how much their apps are earning. If they have a consistent rank, that is proof that the apps are valid and solid ideas. Use ASO tools like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.apptweak.com/en\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">AppTweak</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.data.ai/en/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Data.ai</a>&nbsp;for this.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ce30\">Find out if your competitors have funding.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"565a\">Have they raised funding? How did they raise funding? Fundraising means that investors think the app idea is a good one. Use the platform&nbsp;<a href=\"https://crunchbase.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CrunchBase</a>&nbsp;for finding out whether they have raised funding.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"6a95\">Find out how big the company is.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"491c\">Find out how many employees work at the offices of the app company. Even if the company hasn’t publicly raised much capital, seeing if they have multiple people working there shows there must have been some sort of private funding that is enabling them to hire people. This is a sign that the company’s idea is valuable and worth investing in. Use&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">LinkedIn</a>&nbsp;for looking at a company size.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"eb10\">Find out if your competitors are in the charts.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"e5ca\">If your competitors are featuring in the top download charts, have acquired funding and are growing, it’s a clear sign there is value in your app idea that is worth pursuing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"9e2c\"><strong>Step 3. Check keywords</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" data-src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/300/1*291tPmDNBZL7ynN44A-JoA.png\" class=\"lazyload\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/300/1*291tPmDNBZL7ynN44A-JoA.png\" alt=\"\"/></noscript></figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"91cc\">Next, come up with some keywords for your app idea, those that describe your app idea and then search for their popularity. Once you have these keywords:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"3a71\">Identify the search popularity and search volume of the keywords.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"de68\">The higher the search popularity number, the more popular are those keywords and the app ideas. This means that your idea is valid as a moneymaker. The ASO tools previously mentioned like AppTweak and Data.io are great for this.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"824f\">Find out how many searches with your keywords occur per month.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"58a1\">More than a few hundred searches can mean that the audience for your app is significant and the ones that are interested are also enthusiasts. Use a tool like<em>&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://ads.google.com/intl/en_uk/home/tools/keyword-planner/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Adwords Google Keyword Planner</a><em>&nbsp;</em>for this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"9d1e\">Bare in mind though that if your idea is very niche, a small number of monthly searchers may emerge. In this case, it’s not plausible to think that your idea is bad or unpopular per se, but that it may need a little bit of marketing in order to gauge a larger audience. Whether you’re ready to pour in that much capital to get a return or not is another matter entirely.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"230b\"><strong>Step 4. Get into the minds of users</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" data-src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/300/1*KxiiJMkBlP5Iq1vspBvYHA.png\" class=\"lazyload\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/300/1*KxiiJMkBlP5Iq1vspBvYHA.png\" alt=\"\"/></noscript></figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"4bcb\">At this point, you’ve done some fairly technical work. The next step is to ask for feedback from potential users on whether the app idea is one that could work. Don’t worry about someone stealing your idea. Remember, execution is everything. There are various forums and social platforms that you can use for this, but here’s the one that has consistently delivered results:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"f589\">Reddit</h3>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"e772\"><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Reddit</a>&nbsp;is one of the most popular websites on the internet. According to the Alexa Rankings, it is the 21st most popular site on the internet. It’s a platform organised into various small bubbles in which people comment and share their views on different things. These communities are extremely active and due to the upvote and downvote system, they allow for the most useful information to bubble up and find its way to you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"d71b\">Due to its popularity, how active the community is, and the many different things people can comment and share their views on, it’s an incredibly powerful resource for you to use in helping validate your app idea. You can do a number of things with it but here’s two ways we would use it:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"23d6\">Using Reddit: Part 1</h3>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"7cd3\">The first thing I would use it for is to search and read up on the problem your app is solving. This, of course, is for those of you who are creating an app that’s solving a problem. Search it and see if it’s an actual problem that loads of people either nationwide or worldwide are experiencing. If they are, great! This is a huge step in validation for your idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"812e\">Using Reddit: Part 2</h3>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"7730\">The second thing to do is search your app competitors on the platform. Use this access to an incredibly diverse and active community to find out what’s missing in current app solutions or even, what’s great about them. This information can allow you to formulate a strategy on how to apply those to your app and therefore validate it further.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"7e41\"><strong>Step 5. Ask for feedback from potential users</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" data-src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/300/1*TVTzYS0J8ysZ17V-2lQIzA.png\" class=\"lazyload\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/300/1*TVTzYS0J8ysZ17V-2lQIzA.png\" alt=\"\"/></noscript></figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"6eb6\">Finally, with all of the information you have so far, the most simplest and powerful step to take next is to ask for feedback from potential users. Does this idea solve the problem? Would this be an app you would use? Are these features sufficient to satisfy the first adopters of the app?</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"5787\">This is priceless information. You’re physically asking your audience if this is an app they would use. If they say no, would you still build it? Maybe not. This is an incredibly powerful step to take and it’s so simple, yet it astounds me how many times people do not do this step. Ask your potential audience — would you use this app? Now, the way we have advised clients to do this is to do two things.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"a661\">Get quantitative data</h3>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"397a\">First, create a survey online with questions linked to validating your app idea as seen above e.g. Would you use it? Does this solve the problem? Would you pay monthly for it? Get this survey sent out to as many people who are in your target audience. This could be friends, friends of friends, colleagues, people from your Reddit search, people you may have found at local networking events, meet ups and more. This gives you quantitative data.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"3d63\">Get quanlitative data</h3>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"20d4\">Next, get a group together, around 5–10 people, of your ideal target audience and focus group them. Pitch them your app idea and ask them for their complete and honest feedback. Go through everything you possibly can with them, from the problem the app is solving to the features of the app. After pitching your app, ask for their feedback using open-ended questions. Unlike closed-ended questions which require a simple “yes” or “no”, open-ended questions require more thought and provide you with rich sources of information that you can use to help validate your app idea. This is qualitative data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"2ee5\">Both sources of quantitative and qualitative data are extremely powerful to validate your app idea, and really help in shaping major elements of your app as well in pitches it to investors.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"d0b8\">Summary</h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"a1b2\">Validating your app idea takes time and a number of steps but ask any app founder and the majority will tell you how crucial it is to the process. Your audience are everything to your app, and it’ll be them who are the ones helping you to save time and resources knowing whether to build your app or not. Always remember that even if you do all of the steps above and you get amazing results, there is no guarantee of how popular your app will be until you build it. But it’s the starting point for every new successful app.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"65cc\">If you’re interested in learning more about app development or looking to get started on your app, visit&nbsp;<a href=\"https://digiruu.com/get-started\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">digiruu.com/get-started</a></p>\n</div>        \n      "

Write it down. Start to make it real. This can be as simple or as detailed as you like. The key is to get it down on paper first so you can physically see it. You might think this is unnecessary, but writing it down makes it more than just an idea. Remember that an idea is just a mental thought until it is written down.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What problem is your app solving?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, ask yourself if your app is solving a problem. If so, what problem is your app solving? Are you the first in the market with the solution to this problem, or are you improving upon a current solution that is already on the market? Apps that solve a problem and are focused on the solution to that problem generally do better. A few tips are to think of how you got to your app idea in the first place. Where were you? What was happening? What triggered you to think “hey, an app could be useful here”?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, don’t be disheartened if you see your idea already out there in the market. Not all successful apps were original ideas. Did you know that Apple released the first iPod in 2001 when portable digital music players had been around since the mid-1990’s? Look at the success they had! They looked at the market, saw a problem and noticed that the solutions in place were offering a subpar user experience. So they created their own, and you can do the same. Look at your competition and see if you can improve upon the current solutions. Ask yourself how you can be the “iPod” to the market.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Step 2: Define your target audience</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" alt=\"How to make an app - step 2 - define your target audience\" data-srcset=\"https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/How-to-make-an-app-step-2-define-your-target-audience.png 150w, https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/How-to-make-an-app-step-2-define-your-target-audience-100x100.png 100w, https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/How-to-make-an-app-step-2-define-your-target-audience-140x140.png 140w\" data-src=\"https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/How-to-make-an-app-step-2-define-your-target-audience.png\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" class=\"wp-image-9376 lazyload\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/How-to-make-an-app-step-2-define-your-target-audience.png\" alt=\"How to make an app - step 2 - define your target audience\" class=\"wp-image-9376\" srcset=\"https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/How-to-make-an-app-step-2-define-your-target-audience.png 150w, https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/How-to-make-an-app-step-2-define-your-target-audience-100x100.png 100w, https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/How-to-make-an-app-step-2-define-your-target-audience-140x140.png 140w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" /></noscript></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Who is your app for?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you have your app idea in place and what problem it’s solving, the next step is to know who your app is serving by defining your target audience. You’re providing a solution to a problem, but who is this solution for? Who is experiencing that problem? Successful app businesses get inside the user’s mind and find out who exactly on a deeper level they are providing this solution for. What do they desire? What do they think about? When you know this information, it will help to shape major elements of your app.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So how do you define your target audience? The first thing you want to do is not fall into the trap of thinking “my app is for everyone.” Theoretically, yes, your app could <em>serve</em> everyone, but have you tried <em>marketing</em> to everyone? Two very different things! You want to start with a very targeted and specific, niche audience. This is an audience that refers to a specific subgroup of the target audience that has even more specific characteristics and needs. It is a smaller, more focused group that can be targeted with a more tailored approach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, let’s say you are developing a new fitness app. The target audience for your app would be people who are interested in improving their physical fitness. But within that target audience, there is a niche target audience of people who are specifically interested in yoga. This niche target audience would have specific needs and preferences that are different from the broader target audience of people interested in fitness. You can create a tailored approach to target this niche audience by adding more yoga-specific features and content to your app. So ask yourself, who is my niche target audience?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Market Research</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you have this information, it’s time to conduct market research on your audience to really understand their needs and wants, so you can shape your app towards them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some ways to conduct market research for your app’s target audience:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Surveys: </strong>Surveys are a great way to gather information on your target audience’s demographics, behaviors, and pain points. You can use online survey tools like <a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/\">SurveyMonkey</a>, <a href=\"https://www.typeform.com/\">Typeform</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/forms/about/\">Google Forms</a> to distribute the surveys and gather the responses. Reach out to potential users to get their feedback on your app and their needs.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Interviews: </strong>In-depth interviews are a great way to gain qualitative insights into your target audience’s needs and pain points. You can conduct interviews over the phone, via video conferencing, or in person. Similarly to surveys, reach out to potential users to get their feedback on your app.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Focus groups:</strong> A focus group is a small, diverse group of people who are brought together to discuss a specific topic or product. They can be a useful tool for gaining insights into your target audience’s needs and preferences. Also (you guessed it), reach out to potential users to get their feedback on your app.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Analyse data from social media: </strong>Social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter provide a wealth of data on demographics, interests, and behaviors of their users.

Look at other apps that are similar to yours and see what they are doing well and what they are not doing well. This will give you an idea of what you need to include in your app to make it stand out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When researching your competitors for building an app, there are a few key things you should focus on:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Look at the app stores: </strong>Use the Apple App Store search and Google Play Store to find apps that are similar to yours. Make a list of these apps and take note of their features, pricing, and target audience. Test these apps on actual mobile devices.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Analyse their features: </strong>Look at the features of your competitors’ apps and take note of what they are doing well. This will give you an idea of what you need to include in your app to make it stand out.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Study their reviews: </strong>Look at the reviews of your competitors’ apps on the app store. This will give you an idea of what users like and dislike about the app and what you can do to improve your own app.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Check their ratings: </strong>Look at the ratings of your competitors’ apps on the app store. This will give you an idea of how well the app is performing and how it is being received by users.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Look at their marketing strategies: </strong>Analyse how your competitors are promoting their app. Look at their website, social media accounts, and advertising campaigns. This will give you an idea of what is working well for them and what you can do to improve your own marketing strategy.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Check their engagement: </strong>Look at the number of downloads, active users, and engagement of your competitors’ apps. This will give you an idea of how successful the app is and how you can improve your own app’s engagement.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Analyse your competitors</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are several tools that you can use to analyze your app competitors engagement levels, such as number of downloads, active users, and engagement levels:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://sensortower.com/\">Sensor Tower:</a> </strong>This tool provides detailed app store data, including estimated downloads, revenue, and reviews.

A common mistake to want to include too many features at once. This will be a costly and time-consuming task. Remember, focused apps generally perform better than those which are less focused.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ask yourself what are the features needed in your app that are sufficient to satisfy your first set of users? What we are doing here is turning your idea into a minimum viable product (MVP). MVP features are the most important and basic features that your app needs to have in order to be functional and solve the main problem that your app addresses. These essential features are the bare minimum that your app needs to have to be successful and should be prioritised over other features that may be nice to have but are not crucial for the app’s main purpose. This saves you an abundance of time and resources.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To identify MVP features, you can use the information gathered from market research and data analysis to understand the needs and pain points of your target audience. Identify the features that are essential for meeting those needs, and then add additional features as needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The MoSCoW Matrix</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To help with defining your MVP features, you can use a MoSCoW matrix. The MoSCoW matrix is a prioritisation technique that is often used to define MVP (Minimum Viable Product) features for an app. The acronym MoSCoW stands for Must-Have, Should-Have, Could-Have, and Won’t-Have. The matrix is used to categorise features based on their level of importance, and helps to ensure that the most important features are included in the MVP while less important features can be added later.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Must-Have: </strong>These are the features that are considered essential for the app to function and address the main problem it’s solving. These features are non-negotiable and must be included in the MVP.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Should-Have: </strong>These are features that are important, but not essential. They should be included in the MVP if possible, but can be deferred to a later release if necessary.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Could-Have: </strong>These are features that would be nice to have, but are not essential. They can be deferred to a later release or not implemented at all if necessary.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Won’t-Have:</strong> These are features that are not important to the app’s main purpose and can be deferred or not implemented at all.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The MoSCoW matrix helps to ensure that the most important features are included in the MVP while less important features can be added later. This can help you to focus on the core functionality of your app, while also providing a valuable and usable product to your target audience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s important to keep in mind that MVP features are not necessarily limited to the initial release of your app. As you gather feedback from users and analyse app performance, you may find that there are additional features that need to be added in order to meet the needs of your target audience better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s also worth noting that having an MVP does not mean that your app has to be basic or lacking in popular app features. It’s about finding the balance between what is necessary to address the problem your app is solving and what can be added later on, while still providing a valuable and usable product to your target audience.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Step 5: Monestising your app</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" alt=\"How to make an app - step 5 - monetising your app\" data-srcset=\"https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/How-to-make-an-app-step-5-monetising-your-app.png 150w, https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/How-to-make-an-app-step-5-monetising-your-app-100x100.png 100w, https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/How-to-make-an-app-step-5-monetising-your-app-140x140.png 140w\" data-src=\"https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/How-to-make-an-app-step-5-monetising-your-app.png\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" class=\"wp-image-9379 lazyload\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/How-to-make-an-app-step-5-monetising-your-app.png\" alt=\"How to make an app - step 5 - monetising your app\" class=\"wp-image-9379\" srcset=\"https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/How-to-make-an-app-step-5-monetising-your-app.png 150w, https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/How-to-make-an-app-step-5-monetising-your-app-100x100.png 100w, https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/How-to-make-an-app-step-5-monetising-your-app-140x140.png 140w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" /></noscript></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you have the features for your app, it’s a good time to think about how you’re going to earn revenue from your app. To start, let’s take a look at each model when it comes to making money from apps in the app store.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The free model</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>First the free model. The free model is launching your app for free with all of the features as intended. This is great because there is no barrier for users to download your app. They don’t have to give anything in return, leading to high-traffic numbers compared to paid apps. But how do people make money from the free model? Normally this is through advertising. As the number of customers with smartphones increases, more advertisers are switching to mobile advertising to reach their target audiences.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The paid model</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The next model is charging users to download your app in exchange for a fee. The concept is simple enough – you make money when a user purchases your app. The more downloads you get, the more money you get from sales. Often this is what most people who build an app for the first time want to do. They want their investment back straight away so they charge users to download their app. Consumers must buy before they try. But this idea can often be a turnoff for users. With us living in this digital age, people want to see value first before they pull their cards out to make a purchase.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The freemium model</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The final model is called the freemium model. The freemium model is having users download your app for free but with optional paid premium content i.e. in-app purchases. It allows the user to try your app before they buy. The app provides value free of charge to the consumer. Once they see they’re getting this value, such as an app making a normal day task quicker and easier, they are more likely to pull their card out and spend money with you on the app i.e. make an in-app purchase in exchange for even more value.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most common in-app purchase you probably see nowadays is subscription in-app purchases. These are, as the name suggests, buying services or content within an app for a specific subscription period. Examples include buying a sports season pass or getting a subscription from Netflix, or Spotify. These can be non-renewing subscriptions where after the specified subscription period, the user would have to buy it again. It can also be auto-renewing, which again as the name suggests the app would automatically renew that subscription.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Only you can decide which model is best for your business and your target audience. The important thing to remember is to let the market research about your target audience and competitor research guide the decision. For us, we recommend the freemium model with subscription in-app purchases.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Step 6: Wireframing your app</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" alt=\"How to make an app - step 6 - wireframing your app\" data-srcset=\"https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/How-to-make-an-app-step-6-wireframing-your-app.png 150w, https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/How-to-make-an-app-step-6-wireframing-your-app-100x100.png 100w, https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/How-to-make-an-app-step-6-wireframing-your-app-140x140.png 140w\" data-src=\"https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/How-to-make-an-app-step-6-wireframing-your-app.png\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" class=\"wp-image-9380 lazyload\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/How-to-make-an-app-step-6-wireframing-your-app.png\" alt=\"How to make an app - step 6 - wireframing your app\" class=\"wp-image-9380\" srcset=\"https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/How-to-make-an-app-step-6-wireframing-your-app.png 150w, https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/How-to-make-an-app-step-6-wireframing-your-app-100x100.png 100w, https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/How-to-make-an-app-step-6-wireframing-your-app-140x140.png 140w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" /></noscript></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>With everything you have learned so far, it’s time to start creating your app design, starting with wireframes. Wireframing is the process of creating a visual representation of the structure and layout of an app before it is built. There are several tools that you can use to wireframe your app, including:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://balsamiq.com/\">Balsamiq:</a> </strong>This is a popular wireframing tool that offers a wide range of pre-built UI (user interface) elements and a simple drag-and-drop interface. It also allows you to easily create and share wireframes with your team. It’s best for non-technical users as it requires no coding skills or technical skills.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.axure.com/\">Axure:</a> </strong>This is a powerful wireframing tool that offers advanced prototyping capabilities, allowing you to create interactive wireframes and test user flows.

Should you launch it on Apple and their iPhone first or Google’s Android, or both? Most people who want to build an app want to launch it on both mobile platforms to start with. This is absolutely fine if that’s the route you want to go down but two words of warning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, this can be costly because if you’re building your app for both iPhone and Android, most often you would need separate developers for each platform as different programming languages and coding skills are needed. You need a developer for each platform so you’ll have to pay for that resource.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Secondly, it can be risky. You may have done all of the research in the world but no one knows how users are going to respond to your app. If you build your app for both operating systems with twice the effort, and users don’t respond to it well, that’s a lot of your time, effort and resources that have been wasted. Now they could, of course, respond very well to your app and it could be a stroke of genius. However, because of the uncertainty involved, most people tend to start with one or the other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So which one should platform should you start with? Let’s look at two key factors in the decision-making process.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Factor 1: Your audience</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Are your audience outside of the U.S and Europe? If so, it is possible that Android should be your first priority as it dominates sales volumes of smartphones in Asia, Africa, and South America. Otherwise, iPhone would be your best shot as the average iOS user is often from North America or Europe.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Factor 2: Complexity</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Developing Android apps is more complex than iOS. This is because when different manufacturers adopt the Android operating system to use in their phones, they tweak and tailor it specifically to their products. The Android version you see on a Samsung will be different to the version you see on a Sony or LG phone. Now because of these different versions of the Android operating system on the market, your app could react differently between each phone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In contrast, Apple are the only ones who make products with iOS running on them. You won’t find hundreds of different types of them. You have the iPhones and the iPads which is a considerably smaller variety than the number of Android devices. Also, iOS users tend to keep their software up-to-date: 80% of iOS users are on the same version while there isn’t a single version of Android that hosts more than 50% of users. As a result, testing an Android app to remove bugs and crashes can take longer compared to doing so on iPhone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly to before, only your target audience data and your competitor research will dictate what platform to launch your app on first. If it was us, we would go with iOS to begin with as the programming language for your app and launch it in the Apple App Store.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But before we move on…</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Choose a native programming language or cross-platform app language?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s important to know that there are multiple languages for app building. You can get native development and you can get hybrid development. Native development refers to building mobile apps specifically for one platform using the programming languages and development tools that are officially supported by that platform. For example, building an iOS app using native programming languages such as Objective-C or Swift and Xcode, or building an Android app using Java or Kotlin and Android Studio.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hybrid app development refers to building mobile apps using web technologies (such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) that are then wrapped in a native container, which allows them to be distributed through app stores and accessed on mobile devices. Examples of frameworks for building hybrid apps include Flutter and React Native.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The main difference between the two is that native development builds apps that are specifically for one platform, while hybrid apps are built using web technologies and can be run on multiple platforms. Hybrid apps may have some limitations in terms of performance and access to device features compared to native apps, but they can make the app making process simpler and reduce the duration of app building time. For us, the answer is simple when choosing an app development method – use a native programming language. It’s the gold standard in app programming and you can get full access to the device capabilities.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Step 8: Your app development team</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" alt=\"Your development team\" data-srcset=\"https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/How-to-make-an-app-step-8-team.png 150w, https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/How-to-make-an-app-step-8-team-100x100.png 100w, https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/How-to-make-an-app-step-8-team-140x140.png 140w\" data-src=\"https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/How-to-make-an-app-step-8-team.png\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" class=\"wp-image-9382 lazyload\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/How-to-make-an-app-step-8-team.png\" alt=\"Your development team\" class=\"wp-image-9382\" srcset=\"https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/How-to-make-an-app-step-8-team.png 150w, https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/How-to-make-an-app-step-8-team-100x100.png 100w, https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/How-to-make-an-app-step-8-team-140x140.png 140w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" /></noscript></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The last step is to get your development team together to help build your app. Now unless you’re planning on hiring an in-house design and development team full-time, the two options you’ve probably got for creating your app are using either a freelance app builder or a mobile app development agency. There is a third option using app building platforms, sometimes called app building software or no-code development platforms, but even now in 2023, they have limited functionality and their quality can be quite low so we’ll ignore that for now. So the question (for now) is, which should you use – a freelance app builder or an agency?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a common question I get asked because, well let’s face it, using freelance app builders can be significantly cheaper than using an agency particularly if you use a freelancer abroad, and that’s something I completely understand. But just as there are advantages, there are disadvantages also. Similarly, using an agency has its advantages and disadvantages. So which one should you go for? Having been in the industry for just under a decade, I feel like I’m in the best place to answer this question.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In my experience, I believe there are two key elements to judge. In no particular order of priority, these are:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Price</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Team</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Element 1: Price</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s no competition here and you could probably guess already – the winner goes to freelance app builders. 90% of the time, the price of hiring a freelance app builder to develop your app is significantly cheaper than using an agency. I can’t speak for all of the freelancers online, but in my experience, this has always been the case here in London, UK. Past hires have told us that the average prices of building an app with a freelance app builder can range from £1000 – £20,000.00. In contrast, building apps with an agency can cost anywhere from £50,000 to £100,000, with some even going up to hundreds of thousands of pounds and even millions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Element 2: Team</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Working with an app agency almost certainly guarantees that you’ll have a team of people working on your app. A typical team would include a UI/UX designer, a project manager, and three to four experienced developers with technical skills in various programming languages. A freelancer online mostly consists of one person, the majority of the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you might already have guessed, it is much more advantageous to work with a team than with a single person who could do the design and development. Why? You want experts in each area of your app’s production. For example, let’s say you had an expert designer and you had an expert development team. The two combined would make your app look great and perform great too. But if you had a freelancer who was an incredible developer, but weak in design, because their skill-set lies in development as they’re an expert there, then you’ll have an app that performs great but aesthetically isn’t the most pleasing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember, you can have the best code in the world but if your graphics look bad, people will be less likely to give your app a chance. Obviously, the ideal situation would be to have a freelancer who can both design and develop apps to an incredibly high standard, but this is rare. As a result, agencies would have to win on this point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For us, the answer is easy – use a mobile app development company to build your app as their guidance, experience and expertise can handle the entire development process for you and tailor it specifically to your target users. You’ll be able to get a full design process including graphic design and custom app design with UI/UX designers. You get access to experienced, mobile app developers that have coding skills for various programming languages. You get access to full product documentation with project managers who have the technical skills to deliver app development projects, and some even help with app marketing strategies.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Step 9: Testing your app</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" alt=\"Testing your app\" data-srcset=\"https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/How-to-make-an-app-step-9-testing.png 150w, https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/How-to-make-an-app-step-9-testing-100x100.png 100w, https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/How-to-make-an-app-step-9-testing-140x140.png 140w\" data-src=\"https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/How-to-make-an-app-step-9-testing.png\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" class=\"wp-image-9383 lazyload\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/How-to-make-an-app-step-9-testing.png\" alt=\"Testing your app\" class=\"wp-image-9383\" srcset=\"https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/How-to-make-an-app-step-9-testing.png 150w, https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/How-to-make-an-app-step-9-testing-100x100.png 100w, https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/How-to-make-an-app-step-9-testing-140x140.png 140w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" /></noscript></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you have coded your app, you need to test it with actual users. This is the process of making sure that your app is working correctly and that there are no bugs. It is important to test your app on different devices and in different environments to make sure that it works correctly. This is the moment where you can get invaluable user feedback to understand if the user experience is optimal in successfully fulfilling your app’s purpose. A mobile app development company can help here so don’t feel that you’re alone in this process. They often use a development environment rather than a live environment for app testing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are several tools that you can use to test your app and get user feedback, including:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.usertesting.com/\">UserTesting:</a> </strong>This tool allows you to conduct usability testing by having real users complete tasks and provide feedback on your app. It also provides a dashboard that allows you to analyse the results and make data-driven decisions.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://apptimize.com/\">Apptimize:</a> </strong>This tool allows you to test different versions of your app with real users in order to gather feedback and measure performance. It also provides a dashboard that allows you to analyze the results and make data-driven decisions.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://abtesting.ai/\">A/B Testing:</a> </strong>This tool allows you to test different versions of your app with real users in order to gather feedback and measure performance. You can test different elements of your app such as design, layout, and features to see which version performs better.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Feedback Forms: </strong>Feedback forms can be used to gather feedback on your app from users. You can use tools such as SurveyMonkey, Typeform, or Google Forms to create and distribute forms.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Beta Testing:</strong> Beta testing allows you to test your app with a small group of users before releasing it to the public. You can use tools such as Testflight (iOS), which is available in App Store Connect, or Google Play Beta Testing (Android) to distribute your app to beta testers and gather feedback.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s worth noting that, while these tools can provide valuable insights on your app’s usability, performance, and user engagement, it’s important to combine these data with other sources such as surveys, interviews, and social media analytics to get a complete picture of your app’s performance and user feedback.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Step 10: App launch</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" alt=\"How to make an app - step 10 - launch your app\" data-srcset=\"https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/How-to-make-an-app-step-10-launch.png 150w, https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/How-to-make-an-app-step-10-launch-100x100.png 100w, https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/How-to-make-an-app-step-10-launch-140x140.png 140w\" data-src=\"https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/How-to-make-an-app-step-10-launch.png\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" class=\"wp-image-9384 lazyload\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/How-to-make-an-app-step-10-launch.png\" alt=\"How to make an app - step 10 - launch your app\" class=\"wp-image-9384\" srcset=\"https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/How-to-make-an-app-step-10-launch.png 150w, https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/How-to-make-an-app-step-10-launch-100x100.png 100w, https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/How-to-make-an-app-step-10-launch-140x140.png 140w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" /></noscript></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you have tested your app and fixed any bugs, you can submit it to the app stores, including the Apple App Store and/or Google Play Store for app launch. This is the process of making your app available for download. It is important to make sure that your app meets the guidelines of the app store before you submit it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once your app is available for download, the hard work isn’t done yet as you need to promote it. This includes creating a website for your app, creating social media accounts for your app, and an app marketing plan. This will help to get your app in front of as many people as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Importantly, once your app is live, it is important to maintain it. This includes fixing any bugs, adding new features, and updating the app to keep it up-to-date. By maintaining your app, you will be able to keep your users happy and ensure that your app continues to be successful.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Summary</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Creating an app can be a lot of work, but it is also a lot of fun. By following these 10 steps, you can create an app that is both functional and visually appealing.

    "content": "\n      \n        <div class=\"content-inner\">\n<p>Writing keywords for the App Store can be an important part of your app’s success. Here are some tips to consider when writing your keywords:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Research your audience and competitors: Look at what keywords your target audience is searching for, and what keywords your competitors are using. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Use long-tail keywords: These are more specific, and usually have less competition. For example, “photo editing app” is a long-tail keyword that is more specific than just “photo app.”</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Use relevant terms: Make sure the keywords you choose are relevant to your app.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Use all 100 characters: The App Store allows you to enter up to 100 characters for your keywords, so make sure to use all of them.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Use keyword phrases: Instead of just single keywords, use phrases that are more likely to be searched for.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Avoid using non-alphanumeric characters: The App Store will ignore any non-alphanumeric characters, so it’s best to stick to letters and numbers.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Separate keywords with a comma: This helps the App Store understand which keywords are most important.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a few ways you can research your competitors’ keywords on the App Store:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Check out the “Keywords” section of your competitors’ App Store listing. This can give you an idea of the terms they are targeting.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Use a keyword research tool: There are several tools available that can help you see which keywords are being used by your competitors. Some popular options include Sensor Tower, Mobile Action, and App Annie.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Search for your competitors on the App Store: Type the name of your competitors’ app into the App Store search bar and see which keywords are being used in their app listing.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Look at your competitors’ marketing materials: Check out your competitors’ website, social media accounts, and other marketing materials to see which keywords they are using to describe their app.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Analyze your competitors’ user reviews: Look at the reviews for your competitors’ app and see if there are any common themes or keywords that come up.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re wondering what long-tail keywords are, long-tail keywords are more specific, longer phrases that people might use when searching for something online. They are called “long-tail” because they are made up of multiple words, and are usually longer than more general, short-tail keywords.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Long-tail keywords are often more targeted and less competitive than short-tail keywords, and can be an effective way to drive traffic to your app or website. For example, “photo editing app for iPhone” is a long-tail keyword, while “photo app” is a short-tail keyword.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using long-tail keywords can be especially useful for app developers, as it can help your app rank for specific, relevant search terms. It’s important to research and choose the right long-tail keywords for your app, as they can help you reach the right audience and improve your visibility in the App Store.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What’s an example of good App Store Keywords?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s difficult to give a single example of “good” App Store keywords, as the best keywords for your app will depend on a variety of factors, including your app’s target audience, the features and functionality of your app, and the competitive landscape in your app’s category.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With that said, here is an example of a set of App Store keywords that a developer of a photo editing app might consider using:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>photo editing, edit photos, filters, effects, enhance, camera, picture, Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These keywords are relevant to the app and describe some of its key features, such as photo editing and filters. They also include popular social media platforms where people might use the app, as well as more general terms like “edit photos” and “enhance.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep in mind that the App Store allows you to use up to 100 characters for your keywords, so you should try to use as many relevant keywords as possible to help your app be discovered by potential users.</p>\n</div>        \n      "

    "content": "\n      \n        <div class=\"content-inner\">\n<p>Hi, Aman here – the founder and CEO at Digiruu. When I started this company more than six years ago, I wanted to address three key gaps in the market, one of which was to address the terrible customer service that existed in the software industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From my experience of working with app developers (prior to starting the company when I was launching my own app) was that nobody ever wanted to jump on a call or have a face-to-face meetings. They wanted to do everything by email, which was slow and frustrating. In addition, to get status updates on my project, I was the one reaching out. I was the one paying them! Why should I have to chase up updates on my project?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It really bugged me and now years later with my own app development company, I made a promise that we were going to have the best customer service in the industry and nothing was going to stop us. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With all of that said, it gives me great pleasure in saying that for the amazing customer service that we continuously strive towards, we’ve been awarded the<strong> “Most Client-Centric App Development Boutique” </strong>in England at the <strong>IT Awards 2022!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s what they had to say:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“In the face of unprecedented hardship and uncertainty for UK businesses over the pandemic, the IT sector has played a critical part in ensuring businesses can stay connected, adapt, and continue to trade in an increasingly digital society.&nbsp;We believe&nbsp;more than ever the incredible dedication by these enterprises should be recognised.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, I am excited to be able to share the final results from our panel of judges and&nbsp;I am delighted to say it’s great news! Digiruu&nbsp;has been awarded;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Most Client-Centric App Development Boutique – England</strong><strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>It goes without saying that this is a fantastic achievement for Digiruu and a true marker of the hard work and commitment invested day to day.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I. Could. Not. Be. Happier! We have won awards at Digiruu before but the feeling never goes away when you win another. This is one of the best awards we could win, that out of all <a href=\"https://www.designrush.com/agency/software-development\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Software Development Companies</a> in England which offer app development, <strong>we are the most client-centric!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s amazing news and I couldn’t be more grateful to our amazing team, clients and anyone that supports or ever has supported us. A huge thank you to everyone in Digiruu and working with Digiruu. Let’s chase some more awards! </p>\n</div>        \n      "

    "title": "Top 10 Apps for Designing Social Media Posts.",
    "content": "\n      \n        <div class=\"content-inner\">\n<p> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s no denying the importance of social media in our everyday lives, but I’m not just talking about keeping up to date with what our friends ate for lunch today. For many people social media has become way more than just taking a picture of your katsu curry and hitting post. It’s a source of income for many people, and for others it’s their main marketing channel. So, whether you’re a business or an influencer, looks matter. Which is why in this post we’re talking design, specifically for social media, based on my own experience and some research I’ve put together, here are the top 10 apps for designing social media posts.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ripl:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first app I want to talk about is Ripl, let’s start by getting all the boring stuff out the way. Ripl is a “freemium” app available on both iphone and android, as well as ipad and desktop. However, the free version includes a watermark at the bottom of each image designed or edited through their app. If you wish to have the watermark removed as well as a few added extras they offer two paid options, either $14.99 per month or $119.88 a year, both come with a 7-day free trial. Now let’s talk about what really matters, what does the app offer? So, having served 3.5 million small business’ so far Ripl is a very credible app, with several offerings, including 500,000 stock images available for use. 1000s of ready-made templates, and the tools to track social media engagements by channel. Overall Ripl is a fantastic social media design/editing app, we found it super useful when it comes to business use, it splits all its editing tools and features into categories, e.g., “Beauty &amp; Personal Care” and “Government &amp; Non-profit” making it easy to tease out what’s necessary for your business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>App store rating: 4.8/5</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Canva:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next up we have Canva, which is probably the one you have most likely heard of, it’s super easy and helps create some super professional looking social media posts! Much like Ripl, Canva offers a free version as well as a pro-version. Both versions offer a huge range of templates, images, and tools. Canva pro costs £10.99 per month or £107.99 per year. Canva is the perfect app for businesses and small businesses who use social media as their main marketing channel. It allows users to create ‘teams’ whereby multiple people can work on one design; it also allows you to organise your designs into folders and share them directly from the app on to your social media platforms. A unique feature is that Canva offers the kind of fonts you would find on a desktop, allowing users to maintain consistency on all their platforms. Some social media design apps only offer their own unique fonts, which can sometimes be annoying for users who want to have the same font all round. Canva is the perfect app for creating professional looking social media posts, and we also found it super useful for creating and designing logos.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>App store rating: 4.8/5</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Inshot – Video Editor:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is one seriously COOL app; it’s focus is editing videos. Tools include, video trimming, cutting, and deleting, merging videos, adjusting speed, adding music and sound effects, voice overs and the list goes on. However, in my opinion the coolest feature on this app is the greenscreen feature, which allows you to create a video anywhere in the world from the comfort of your living room! However, I think InShot’s biggest selling point is the price, they offer InShot Pro for just £11.49 per year, in comparison to the other apps we’ve spoken about this is super affordable and this version offers access to all features and paid editing materials including stickers and filter packages. As well as all watermarks and advertisements being removed automatically. This one’s a no brainer if you ask me! Overall, we found this app super useful as an alternative to editing on desktop, it’s like a professional video editor that fits right into your pocket so you can edit videos anytime, anywhere.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>App store rating 4.8/5</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>DesignLab – Graphic Design:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>DesignLab is a fantastic graphic design app which helps you put together some very professional posts on social media, with over a million images to choose from. DesignLab markets itself as a “Graphic Design” app and its users are using it for exactly that, with many people designing album covers, business cards, birthday cards, invitations, and even real estate promotion. This list shows just how diverse the app features are. The features include, Customizable templates, the ability to save projects and continue editing them later, free stock photography (we’re talking millions of images!), advanced text tools, stunning artwork, layer-based editing, photo Filters and photo adjustments.&nbsp; A super useful feature on this app is that you can also set the app to “dark mode” for those late-night editing sessions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>App store rating: 4.6/5</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Over (Now GoDaddy Studio):</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Previously known as Over, GoDaddy studio is an editing app for all things social media. Using this app, you can create logos, edit photos, and put together posters and flyers that can be shared electronically via social media platforms such as Instagram, Pinterest, and Facebook. GoDaddy studio markets as an app for businesses who need professional photo editing at a fast pace. Unlike the previously listed apps, GoDaddy Studio offers both image and video editing. However, this USP comes with a cost, if you wish to use GoDaddy Studio at its full capacity then you will need to pay for the pro version which comes at a cost of £84.99 per year. Overall we found GoDaddy Studio extremely useful for editing videos as it allows you to edit both existing videos from your camera roll and a huge selection of exclusive stock videos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>App store rating: 4.8/5</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Clay:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clay is all about aesthetics, it’s the perfect app for up-and-coming social media influencers. Despite the controversy, social media influence is all about portraying the best version of any situation. Whether that be having a meal, doing a workout or even lying-in bed! Clay is a slightly less extensive app, and it’s more for daily use when uploading stories. Clay markets itself as an app for influencers. Some might say that aesthetics isn’t at the forefront of social media marketing, but it’s the first thing users notice when they come across your, page, post, or story. The choice of colour, and the images and visuals used are all part of your brand identity and they define you. It’s how users will remember your brand, product of service. Clay’s focus is to create the best possible aesthetic to be remembered by. Overall, we feel Clay is THE perfect app when it comes to aesthetics and its best feature is its simplicity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>App Store rating: 4.5/5</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Blastr:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is one for the bargain hunters! If you’re looking for a super affordable pro version of any social media design app, then this is the one for you. Blastr offers its pro version for $2.99 per month or $17.99 per year. This enables you to unlock all templates, over 300 fonts, over 4000 stickers, and over 1 million royalty free stock images, as well as remove all ads from the app, to stop interfering with those creative juices! A cool feature on Blastr, is that it allows you to create memes, and who doesn’t love a meme? Not only do they make us laugh, but have you heard of the new marketing strategy, “meme marketing”? According to a recent study<strong>, memes can yield 60% organic engagement on social media platforms</strong>. For this reason alone, meme pages are being offered huge commissions for product and service advertisement due to their level of reach. Perhaps <strong>Blastr</strong> could help you create some meme marketing gold!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>App Store rating: 5/5</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I<strong>mpresso: Video design studio&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Impresso is one for small businesses who are looking to create high quality videos to be uploaded on their social media platforms, both inexpensively and quickly, the app offers both a free version and a PRO video editor version, at a yearly cost of £49.99. Making it super inexpensive for small businesses and up and coming influencers. In terms of Video editing, we found Impresso to be the easiest app to use on the market.&nbsp; All the reviews rave about the quality of the video designing tools and we can confirm the quality is impeccable, and it’s also super easy to use! We found that impresso is the best video editing app for posting directly to your social media pages. While most social media design posts offer the option to post, they do not offer the option to post directly to reels, stories and IGTV, impresso however does. Impressive right?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>App store rating: 4.7/5</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Boosted Ad Maker by Lightricks:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This app is all about ad making, so if your main purpose of posting on social media is to advertise a service or product. Then this is the app for you. “Boost your brand or business with boosted” is their main philosophy. You can create ads, tips, tutorials and pretty much anything else you can think of. The App also offers a premium version which gives users unlimited access to all video templates and 50% off photos from Getty images. Based on recent studies<strong>, 49% of internet users</strong> say they are likely to purchase from brands they see advertised on social media. Boosted is the perfect app for creating eye-catching ads that are bound to sell your products and services! In terms of creating ads, boosted is the top app on the market, you can create super professional looking ads in moments for free! Yes completely free, this is the only app in our top 10 selection that offers all of its services completely free!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>App store rating: 4.7/5</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mojo – Insta story&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally, it’s all about the stories! No, it really is! There are over <strong>500 million active daily Instagram stories users</strong>, and you NEED to be one of them! Mojo is the number one content making app! It’s always good to end on a high, right? Although Mojo markets themselves as an app for Insta stories, they do in-fact cater for all types of social media video content, including the new craze, TikTok videos. Mojo offers access to over 400 original text styles, effects, music library, animated templates and more. Mojo also offers a pro version at a yearly cost of £29.99. It’s super easy to use and offers a great range of tools regardless of whether you decide to use the app’s free version or pay for the pro version.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>App store rating: 4.9/5</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So now that we’ve covered the top 10 social media post designing apps, let’s conclude on just how important social media design is. With <strong>57.6% of the world’s population using social media daily for an average of 2 hours and 27 minutes</strong>, there’s so much potential to influence, whether your aim is to sell a product, a service or to simply influence people, the key is to stand out.

In fact, stats have shown that the United Kingdom is among the leading three cosmetic consumers in Western Europe. The cosmetics boom in the UK happened in 2017, when the sector’s market value reached a staggering 9.8 billion pounds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem is, and what could be contributing tremendously to this boom, most consumers are buying products they may not necessarily need. Customers often have many different types of cosmetic and skincare products, which makes it near enough impossible to know off the top of their head what they have and what they need when out shopping. As a result, the consumer may develop over-buying habits where products are purchased that they don’t need as they already have them or similar products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Conversely, it means the customer may be missing out buying products that they do actually need i.e. are running out of or are expiring soon.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"473\" height=\"1024\" alt=\"\" data-srcset=\"https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2-473x1024.png 473w, https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2-139x300.png 139w, https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2-768x1662.png 768w, https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2-710x1536.png 710w, https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2-946x2048.png 946w, https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2.png 1242w\" data-src=\"https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2-473x1024.png\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 473px) 100vw, 473px\" class=\"wp-image-7431 ls-is-cached lazyloaded\" src=\"https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2-473x1024.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 473px) 100vw, 473px\" srcset=\"https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2-473x1024.png 473w, https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2-139x300.png 139w, https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2-768x1662.png 768w, https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2-710x1536.png 710w, https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2-946x2048.png 946w, https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2.png 1242w\"><noscript><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"473\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2-473x1024.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7431\" srcset=\"https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2-473x1024.png 473w, https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2-139x300.png 139w, https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2-768x1662.png 768w, https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2-710x1536.png 710w, https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2-946x2048.png 946w, https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2.png 1242w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 473px) 100vw, 473px\" /></noscript></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, this over-buying habit is significantly contributing to the amount of waste the UK is producing. There are not many statistics available specifically for cosmetics, but it has been suggested that the industry produces 120 billion units of packaging per year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is having a significant impact on the environment as most consumers are unclear if they can recycle these products, and if so, how to recycle them. This is because packaging is often composed of a variety of types of material — mirrored glass, cardboard sleeves, paper inserts, expanded plastic foam and more – sometimes all in one item. This makes recycling them incredibly difficult.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"473\" height=\"1024\" alt=\"\"

expiring and how to recycle them. The platform will be designed to <strong>maximise engagement, build brand loyalty to Skinfy</strong> and <strong>create raving fans, </strong>that will ultimately lead to <strong>increased social proof </strong>and <strong>new customers </strong>that subsequently increases<strong> revenue.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1242\" height=\"2688\" alt=\"\" data-srcset=\"https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4-473x1024.png 473w, https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4-139x300.png 139w, https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4-768x1662.png 768w, https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4-710x1536.png 710w, https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4-946x2048.png 946w, https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.png 1242w\" data-src=\"https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4-473x1024.png\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 1242px) 100vw, 1242px\" class=\"wp-image-7433 lazyload\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1242\" height=\"2688\" src=\"https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4-473x1024.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7433\" srcset=\"https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4-473x1024.png 473w, https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4-139x300.png 139w, https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4-768x1662.png 768w, https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4-710x1536.png 710w, https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4-946x2048.png 946w, https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.png 1242w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1242px) 100vw, 1242px\" /></noscript></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>What we focussed on were these points:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Create an onboarding experience for users when first downloading the app</strong> to deliver initial value so the user is clear on what to expect. This will help to <strong>engage the user, take them through the journey and motivate them to sign-up.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Making the process of keeping inventory of skincare products as efficient as possible. </strong>Your platform serves a very clear and direct purpose, which is to keep inventory of skincare products as easy as possible. This direct purpose shows the user how the platform fits into their lives, and as a result, they are more likely to use it. Our focus, therefore, will be to make sure the website/app serves this purpose in the least amount of steps possible. This strong focus on the user experience will ensure the platform is <strong>optimised for maximum engagement.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Build strong trust and a closer relationship with customers through push notification messaging. </strong>Push notifications are read 80% of the time vs 15% for email (on average). This means you will be able to get your message out to more customers and<strong> increase your chances of getting the right message to the right customer at the right time, </strong>which will undoubtedly help to build a stronger customer relationship and help to <strong>create raving fans.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"473\" height=\"1024\" alt=\"\" data-srcset=\"https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/5-473x1024.png 473w, https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/5-139x300.png 139w, https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/5-768x1662.png 768w, https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/5-710x1536.png 710w, https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/5-946x2048.png 946w, https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/5.png 1242w\" data-src=\"https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/5-473x1024.png\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 473px) 100vw, 473px\" class=\"wp-image-7434 lazyload\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"473\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/5-473x1024.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7434\" srcset=\"https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/5-473x1024.png 473w, https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/5-139x300.png 139w, https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/5-768x1662.png 768w, https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/5-710x1536.png 710w, https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/5-946x2048.png 946w, https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/5.png 1242w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 473px) 100vw, 473px\" /></noscript></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center wp-block-heading\"><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/skinfy/id1535458774\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Download Skinfy</a> and know which products you need, which are expiring and find out how to recycle them once they have expired.</h2>\n</div>        \n      "

We were extremely happy with the news as we couldn’t imagine something like that happening.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year we got another email from Clutch, saying that we did it again! Digiruu is once more one of the top development companies in the UK.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"229\" height=\"248\" alt=\"\" data-src=\"https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image-3.png\" class=\"wp-image-3857 ls-is-cached lazyloaded\" src=\"https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image-3.png\"><noscript><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"229\" height=\"248\" src=\"https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image-3.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3857\"/></noscript></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>To gain this achievement once is amazing by itself. But to do it back-to-back definitely means we’re onto something that our clients are responding positively towards. This is because in order to be <a href=\"https://clutch.co/uk/app-developers\">recognised as a top</a> performer in your industry by Clutch they need to hear it from your clients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a review platform, they use a unique verification process that ensures they only talk to legitimate partners and get their <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/joefolkman/2019/11/29/what-is-honest-feedback/?sh=789756842d47\">honest feedback</a> on the vendors they worked with. This is why our Founder couldn’t help but say a few things when we got the news:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“<em>On the eve of our fifth birthday, if someone said we would be in this position when I started the company, I wouldn’t have believed them! Thank you so much to the team at Clutch and all the team at Digiruu for their amazing work. Finally, a huge thank you to all of our innovative clients for trusting us with their amazing projects.</em>” – Aman Birdi, Founder of Digiruu.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If last year is anything to go by, 2021 will be an even better year for the Digiruu team.

    "content": "\n      \n        <div class=\"content-inner\">\n<p>A common question we get is how to make money with apps. Often people ask because they don’t know whether to charge users to download their app or have them download it for free. And if they were to download it for free, how do they make money from it? It’s a big decision when it comes to launching your app, and can have huge implications for the amount of revenue you have coming in.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>But before we look into the answer, let me point out that there’s a common misconception out there that you make the most money with apps that you charge users to download. This isn’t true at all which you’ll see in just a moment. Another thing to point out – most people invest a lot of their valuable time, effort and resources into building an app.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Naturally, when it’s done, they want to charge immediately at launch to start recuperating their money. This can be detrimental to an app’s success. So when if you’re launching an app for the first time, keep an open mind. Don’t dismiss the idea straight away of launching your app for free. In the long term, it could actually make you a lot more.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How To Make Money With Apps: The 3 Strategies</h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the three main revenue models when it comes to apps: </p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. Having users download your app for free</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. Charging users download your app in exchange for a fee like 99p</p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. Having users download your app for free but with optional paid content within the app i.e. in-app purchases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So which is this best model on how to make money with apps? Let’s take a look at each one.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">#1 The Free Model To Make Money With Apps</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>First the free model. The free model is launching your app for free with all of the features as intended. This is great because there’s no barrier for users to download. They don’t have to give anything in return, leading to high-traffic numbers compared to paid apps.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>But how do people make money with apps from the free model? Normally this is through advertising. As the number of customers with smartphones increases, more advertisers are switching to mobile advertising to reach their target audiences. Gary Vee recently spoke about how businesses are wasting huge amount of resources on TV ads.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What does everyone do when an advert comes on?<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>They pick up their phone! So advertising on mobile is definitely valuable to companies and therefore, the developers like you that allows ads from these companies on their app.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How do ads work in apps?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So how do ads in apps work? Well let’s say you’ve built your app and want to get adverts on it. Do you go to each company in the world and ask them if they want to advertise on your app? Of course not because that would take a whole bunch of time right? You use what’s called a mobile ad network.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mobile ad networks are like the middlemen of adverts in apps. You have companies that want to advertise their product or services on your app. And then you have your app which has space for adverts. The middlemen, i.e. these mobile ad networks will be in the middle to arrange the sales and placement of ads between these companies that want to advertise on your app and presenting them on your ad space within your app.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The mobile ad networks do all the hard work for you!</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>These ads can be from more than one different companies. The way it works is that companies, depending on how much they pay the mobile ad network, get allocated ad space. This is why you sometimes see one company being on your app at a certain time, and then a different company on your app at another time.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>They just have a different amount of ad space or a different type of ad space based on the target audience using your app at the time. For example, a 60 year old using your app may have a different advert compared to a 20 year old using your app, even though they’re both using it at the same time.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The key thing to understand with adverts is that everyone wins. The advertisers benefit from the sales that result from their ads, and you the developer, earns revenue from the ads. Plus users often get targeted ads to of things that might actually be interested in.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are different types of mobile ad networks but some of the popular ones are <a href=\"https://admob.google.com/home/\">AdMob from Google</a>, <a href=\"https://www.adcolony.com/\">AdColony</a> and <a href=\"https://unity.com/solutions/unity-ads\">UnityAds</a>. They each have their own advantages but something key to note is the revenue share. Ad networks for mobile will usually take between 30-40% of the revenue generated from advertising. The remaining 60-70% goes to you.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Impressions VS Clicks</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With adverts now being displayed on the app, how do you get that 60-70% of revenue in your pocket? Two ways:<em> Impressions</em> and <em>Clicks</em>! First let’s look at impressions. Whenever your app displays an ad to users, you have provided one ad impression.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>These impressions are usually low revenue generators for developers. This is because it’s unclear if the user saw the ad or even paid attention to it at all. I mean, if you’re using an app, your attention is on that app function. You wouldn’t be paying attention the ad would you? But some companies are willing to pay for a lot of impressions. This is in the hope that some of them will catch the user’s attention.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, <em>Clicks </em>(or taps) are when a user taps the ad. These are more desirable advertisers because it means consumers are showing a genuine interest in the ad. Consequently, they become more desirable to you as well as advertisers are willing to pay a premium for receiving them. And that in a nutshell, is how the free model works.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">#2 The Paid Model To Make Money With Apps</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The next model on how to make money with apps is the paid model: charging users download your app in exchange for a fee like 99p. The concept is simple enough – you make money when a user purchases your app. That’s all there is to the paid model. The more downloads you get, the more money you get from sales. As mentioned before, often this is what most people who build an app for the first time want to do – they want their investment back straight away so they charge users to download their app.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consumers must buy before they try. But this idea can often be a turnoff for users. With us living in this digital age, people want to see value first before they pull their card out to make a purchase. And that leads perfectly on to the next model.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">#3 The Freemium Model</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The final model on how to make money with apps is called the freemium model. The freemium model is having users download your app for free but with optional paid premium content i.e. in-app purchases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It allows the user to try your app before they buy. The app provides value free of charge to the consumer. Once they see they’re getting this value, such as an app making a normal day task quicker and easier, they are more likely to pull their card out and spend money with you on the app i.e. make an in-app purchase in exchange for even more value.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, one of the things that I’ve learnt very quickly in the app business, and any business for that matter, is to always sell on value – not price. The freemium model fits that perfectly and it’s why some of the most successful apps in the world, such as Candy Crush, Pokemon Go and Clash of Clans consistently feature in the app store’s top charts.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Different Kinds of In-App Purchases</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So what kind of in-app purchases can you get? As a general way of looking at things, there are three types of in-app purchases: consumable, non-consumable and subscription in-app purchases. Consumable in-app purchases are those that you need to buy every time you want them. You can’t redownload them again for free. Examples include currency, hints, extra health, extra experience points etc. One that I saw recently in Candy Crush, by the way I’m in that 1% of population that doesn’t play candy crush,&nbsp; was a lollipop hammer for £1.99.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Non-consumable purchases on the other hand are those items that you buy one time. Examples include upgrading the app to a pro edition, unlocking a full game when you only have a trial version, unlimited hints in a game or even, removing ads.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Removing adverts? Are you sure?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Removing ads is a great in-app purchase to mention here. You can build your app, and have users download it for free with adverts like the free model described above. You then have the luxury of earning money generated from the ads. But let’s face it, nobody likes adverts. So what you can do is give users the options to remove adverts as an in-app purchase, which then means altogether, from one app, you can have the benefits of the paid model along with the benefits of the free model with adverts. Advantages all around!<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally subscription in-app purchases are those, as the name suggests, buying services or content within an app for a specific subscription period. Examples include buying a sports season pass, or getting a subscription from Netflix, or Spotify. These can be non-renewing subscriptions where after the specified subscription period, the user would have to buy it again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or it can be auto-renewing, which again as the name suggests the app would automatically renew that subscription.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Which is the best model to make money with apps?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So now, with all three of the models cleared up and understood, which is the best model for your app to make money? For us, there is a clear winner and you might have guessed it by now – the freemium model. Why? Because it combines the advantages of the free and paid model. The free model is great because the user has nothing to lose when downloading your app.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>They can download it, try it, and if they like it – great. If they don’t, they can delete it. As a result, the amount of traffic generated compared to the paid model where you have to give something in return to “try” the app, is miles apart. The paid model, on the other hand, has the massive advantage that being only available for a fee gives off the impression that this app is valuable and of course, gets you income right away regardless if the user likes your app or not. You get both of these advantages with the freemium model.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">If you don’t believe us…</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s a really quick exercise you can do now. If you’re on iOS, go to Apple’s App Store. Under Top Charts, you’ll see three headings: <em>Paid, Free </em>and <em>Top Grossing.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <em>Top Grossing</em> category lists the apps with the highest total revenue, whether that is from app sales in the paid model or free apps with in-app purchases. Essentially it’s the free and paid apps that are making the most money at this moment in time.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Have a look at the list and see how many of them are available to download for free, and how many of them are paid. At this time right now for me, the top 36 apps in the top grossing category are freemium apps with Minecraft being the first paid app in that list ranking at number 37. That basically says it all!<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there we have it! At Digiruu, we believe you should make your app available for free with in-app purchases by following the freemium model. Although the idea of removing ads as an in-app purchase is an attractive one, we recommend having in-app purchases solely for <strong><a href=\"https://digiruu.com/does-my-business-need-an-app/\">providing more value</a> </strong>to users such as more features as opposed to simply removing ads. Remember, sell on value and not on price!</p>\n</div>        \n      "

They were almost arguing about which was actually the best place to get a haircut! Because my friend owns a barbershop in another part of the city, I listened intently and made mental notes.&nbsp;As they each began to lose interest in winning the argument, one asked a decisive question. He asked how difficult it was to get an appointment with his favorite stylist. The other responded cheerfully, “There’s an app for that!”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My mate is a little old fashioned, but understands the importance of keeping his business relevant to his clientele.&nbsp; We’ve even discussed the possibility of developing a mobile app for his customers. But like most business owners, he doesn’t recognise the impact a mobile app can have on his business. He has yet to realise that <a href=\"http://www.scalewithanapp.com\">companies who choose to incorporate a mobile app into their strategy have seen up to a 60% increase in profits.&nbsp;</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Have YOU considered developing a mobile app for your business? If not, you need to check out the infographic below and read on!<br></p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"does my business need an app\" width=\"256\" height=\"1024\" data-srcset=\"https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Digiruu-1-256x1024.png 256w, https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Digiruu-1-75x300.png 75w, https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Digiruu-1-768x3072.png 768w, https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Digiruu-1-384x1536.png 384w, https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Digiruu-1-512x2048.png 512w\" data-src=\"https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Digiruu-1-256x1024.png\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" class=\"wp-image-3990 ls-is-cached lazyloaded\" src=\"https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Digiruu-1-256x1024.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" srcset=\"https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Digiruu-1-256x1024.png 256w, https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Digiruu-1-75x300.png 75w, https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Digiruu-1-768x3072.png 768w, https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Digiruu-1-384x1536.png 384w, https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Digiruu-1-512x2048.png 512w\"><noscript><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Digiruu-1-256x1024.png\" alt=\"does my business need an app\" class=\"wp-image-3990\" width=\"256\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Digiruu-1-256x1024.png 256w, https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Digiruu-1-75x300.png 75w, https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Digiruu-1-768x3072.png 768w, https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Digiruu-1-384x1536.png 384w, https://digiruu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Digiruu-1-512x2048.png 512w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" /></noscript></figure></div>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Reason #1: <strong>To Maximise Engagement</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We all see people hypnotised by their phones, accessing the never-ending wealth of information and entertainment available at their fingertips. Did you know that the average person spends four to five HOURS on their phone every day? It’s hard to imagine what they are doing that keeps them so occupied and focused. However, statistics tell us almost <strong>92% of that time is spent in mobile apps.</strong> Playing games. Posting on social media. <em>Making an appointment with their hair stylist</em>. The list of mobile apps available is overwhelming, many of them free to users, giving us the ability to avoid having to sit down in front of a computer or laptop to conduct our daily business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Better yet, mobile apps even have the ability to prompt users with notifications that they need our attention. With this increased level of engagement, users are far more likely to continue in the habit of tapping those alluring icons, almost ensuring they will be repeat customers, time and again. Ultimately, this engagement feeds your bottom-line revenue! This is because they have direct access to the solution to their problems through your presence in their pocket.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Reason #2 Why Your Business Needs An App: <strong>To Build Brand Loyalty</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p> Because we each have preferences, we often hold a point of pride in the companies we frequent. The train gents certainly were fond of their barbershops. As a new customer of any business, our most critical evaluation occurs during the first transaction.&nbsp; Beyond that point, any contact either strengthens or weakens our opinion. This is actually great news for savvy business owners that provide consistent value to the clients they serve! Once we prove our value, we can build a certain loyalty with people that can tolerate the occasional hiccup in perfection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking at the rising costs of marketing and advertising to new audiences, the profit margins on those first transactions become razor-thin. In fact, acquiring new customers will cost businesses more than seven times the amount of retaining a current customer. Added to this, <strong>repeat customers often spend 14 times MORE after loyalty has been developed. </strong>By engaging more with current customers through your mobile app, customer loyalty becomes stronger over time. This results directly in more stable cash flow, higher profit margins and even more capital available to help scale your business.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Reason #3: <strong>To Stand Out from Competition</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p> It was clear to the gents on the train, the level of service was a determining factor in how much they would prefer one barber shop over another. Likewise, nothing is more telling about the level of customer service a business provides than how they handle problems and complaints. Should a client encounter a problem or have a question, they typically have only a handful of methods to resolve it. In person, which is time consuming and undesirable. Over the phone, which can be even more time consuming and frustrating. Website navigation, generally confusing and sometimes leaves the situation unresolved. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if you implemented a well-developed mobile app that was focused on solving your customer’s problems, you actually have a chance to become the hero! It might alarm you to know that <strong>66% of businesses without mobile apps have actually seen a decline in reported customer service levels.</strong> Now ask yourself again, does my business need an app? You would probably say yes now, right? Offering customer service solutions through your app helps you stand out from your competition. This solidifies your position as a leader in your industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In most cases, customers walk away from a business within one day should their concerns not be resolved appropriately. Not only will you be prepared to offer the highest levels of service to your current clientele, but you will also become known as the best choice for those unhappy clients of competitive brands.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Reason #4 Why Your Business Needs An App: <strong>To Market More Directly</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p> Many of the justifications for developing an app can actually seem subsidiary at first glance. However customer direct marketing is one immediately tangible benefit.&nbsp; Remember, when your customers choose to download your mobile app, they are actually inviting your message to find them! In the barrage of unrequested and misaligned marketing messages that are hurled at each of us on – what certainly feels like – a constant basis, users of a mobile app will be most receptive to effective and appropriate marketing from their preferred company in that industry.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if I own a golf center, my mobile app users might be predominantly middle-aged men. If my message has information about the newest type of golf ball available, it has more likelihood of striking the mark. Yet, if I sent a marketing message for women’s lingerie to the same group of middle aged men…well, perhaps that is a poor example.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The point being, if the message is not aligned correctly with the intended audience, it misses the mark.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With an app, you can be close to 70% certain that your marketing efforts will align with the audience. This increases their interest in your products or services.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What’s more, as users navigate the app and engage through your process, the data collected will become invaluable to understanding EXACTLY what your customers like and dislike.&nbsp; If you ask one hundred people what features they would like to see in your app, most will not even be able to think of a response. Some will name awkward features or distracting bells and whistles. Once you have the initial version of an app, you will receive data by testing the app with 100 of your well-established customers. Here is where you will be able to tell exactly what they prefer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you custom tailor your features and benefits to the customer over time, you are no longer guessing at what might work and hoping for the best, you will have the answer in the palm of your hand.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Reason #5 Why Your Business Needs An App: <strong>To Provide More Value</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p> Ultimately, the companies that succeed are the ones that are able to provide the most value to their customers. In the past few decades, websites were able to provide a level of value that had never before been experienced. But the truth is, a website is only a basic level of interaction that leaves the process in the hands of the user.&nbsp; They click and scroll, sometimes never finding the solution or function that will meet their needs. With a mobile app, you are able to custom tailor an interactive process. This can determine the user’s needs and provide a solution within moments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most valuable thing in the world is time. People are no longer willing to waste it by waiting patiently for information.&nbsp; Every second that passes pushes their attention further and further from your product or service.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Having a website is great – almost a necessity. But a mobile app will provide a level of value that will set a new standard for your customers’ expectations.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Another source of value presents itself in how your customers communicate with you through an app on their mobile device. There is no need to call them back, shoot them an email, or any other method of communication. Your company can actually respond immediately, THROUGH THE APP! Hold onto your hat because that isn’t the end of the story. You can likewise communicate with the user at any time no matter where they are.&nbsp; Everyone carries their phones with them. Updates and notifications add a level of value that can push your customers into a new paradigm of service. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We all enjoy when a product or service meets our needs and expectations, right? But how much more valuable is it when that product or service suggests itself to us, just at the right moment! The gent on the train understood this immediately. If he were using the mobile app of his favourite barbershop to find the nearest location, the app interacts back. It may ask if he would like to schedule an appointment with his favourite stylist. Or even purchase his favourite shampoo because it has been almost thirty days since he picked up his last bottle. Endless possibilities, unprecedented value.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">To Conclude…</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Does my business need an app? Not every industry model would have great potential for a custom app. The question you have to ask yourself is this:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://digiruu.com/get-started\">Does building brand loyalty with customers over time and providing them with as much value as possible align with the vision and mission of my company?</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If no, then a mobile app may not be the right solution. As the gents on the train convinced me, it certainly would be a great idea for my mate’s barbershop. In fact, I went to visit him and after I was done explaining some of my ideas for an app that would serve his clientele, he suggested that we call to order pizza, hoping to stay in and continue our discussion. You already know what I said, “There’s an app for that!”<br></p>\n</div>        \n      "

    "title": "Build An App For iPhone And Android? The Top Three Reasons To Build For iPhone First",
    "content": "\n      \n        <div class=\"content-inner\">\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Three Reasons Why You Should Build Your App For iOS First</h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Should I build an app for iPhone and Android? It’s a question everybody asks. If I’m launching an app for the first time, which platform should I launch it on? Should I launch it on Apple and its iPhone first or Google’s Android? For us, the answer is easy. Here are the top three reasons to build your app for iPhone first.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, some background. Apps are to smartphones what programs are to computers. The way you have Instagram on your phone is the same as having Microsoft Word on your computer. Now you can get different types of computers, right? You can get a HP laptop or you could get a MacBook. What makes these computers different? Yes, they are made by two different brands. However, the answer to what really makes them different is their operating system.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>What do I mean by this? The HP laptop (and most laptops) run the operating system Windows, made by Microsoft. In contrast, the MacBook runs a different operating system made by its creators, Apple. This is important to know because if you wanted to build a program to run on the HP laptop and run on the Macbook, you would have to build it for each operating system. The reason for this is straightforward. The coding language used to build a program for Windows is different from the coding language needed for the Macbook, despite the program having the exact same functionality.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why is this important? I just want to know whether to build my app for iPhone and Android!</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, the same applies to smartphones. The way laptops have different operating systems, smartphones have different operating systems too. We call these platforms, and the two biggest platforms in the game right now are from Apple and Google.  These are known as iOS (Apple) and Android (Google).<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The one big difference between Apple and Google’s operating systems is that Apple only allows iOS to run on their products. On the other hand, Google’s operating system Android is open source. This means that any manufacturer can adapt and use it on their devices without any costs. This is why you see Android available on loads of devices made by different manufacturers, including LG, Sony and Samsung. This makes it the most widely used mobile operating system!<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if they are the two biggest platforms, why not launch my app for both? Why not build an app for iPhone and Android? You’re not alone in asking this question. Most people who want to build an app want to launch it on both platforms to start with. This is absolutely fine if that’s the route you want to go down, but…<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Build app for iPhone and Android? Two words of warning.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>First, this can be costly because if you build an app for iPhone and Android, most often you would need separate developers for each platform as different skill sets are needed. This goes back to what I was saying about building for a laptop running Microsoft and a Macbook run on Apple’s operating system. You need a developer for each so you’ll have to pay for that resource.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Secondly it can be risky. You may have done all of the research in the world but no one knows how users are going to respond to your app. If you build an app for iPhone and Android with twice the effort, and users don’t respond to it well, that’s a lot of your time, effort and resources that have been wasted. Now they could, of course, respond very well to your app and it could be a stroke of genius. However, because of the uncertainty involved, most people tend to start with one or the other.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So which one? Apple or Android? Let’s look at some key factors in the decision-making process.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Factor 1 – Your Audience</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Are your audience outside of the U.S and Europe? If so, it is possible that Android should be your first priority. This is because it dominates sales volumes of smartphones in Asia, Africa, and South America. Otherwise, iPhone would be your best shot as the iOS user is often from North America or Europe.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Factor 2. Complexity</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Put simply, developing Android apps is more complex than iOS. This is because when different manufacturers adopt the Android operating system to use in their phones, they tweak and tailor it specifically to their products. The Android version you see on a Samsung will be different from the version you see on a Sony or LG. Now because of these different versions of the Android operation system on the market, your app could react differently between each phone.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, there is a lack of standardisation amongst the smartphone manufacturers for Android. The platform is open-source remember, so there’s no restriction on what a manufacturer can do when building a phone for Android. As a result, all Android phones you see tend to have different looks and characteristics such as screen sizes, resolutions and processor speeds.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In contrast Apple are the only ones who make products with iOS running on them. You won’t find hundreds of different types of them. This is a considerably smaller variety than the amount of Android devices. Also, iOS users tend to keep their software up-to-date. Studies have shown that 80% of iOS users are on the same version while there isn’t a single version of Android that hosts more than 50% of users.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a result, testing an Android app to remove bugs and crashes can take longer compared to doing so on iPhone.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Factor 3: Time</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When you’ve built your app and want to publish it online for users to download, Apple and Google have different processes. You see Apple carefully reviews all apps before they can be released in the App Store. Because of this, wait times can be upwards of 10 days. This same process is used when you want to update your app too.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some people find this a massive disadvantage because timing can be so important to an <a href=\"https://digiruu.com/how-to-make-a-successful-app/\">app’s success</a>. If you uploaded and published your app to the App Store, and then found you wanted to quickly change something that needs to be coded into the app, you would have to re-upload a new build, wait for Apple to approve it and then publish it again. This could be in a timeframe when you may lose customers.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, Google Play doesn’t have this barrier. You submit your app to the Google play store and before you know it, your app is ready to be downloaded by users. Even when you update it, no problem. Simply log into your Google Portal dashboard, upload the latest version of your app and publish it. Basically, you can build or change your app and make it available on the Android store easier and quicker than on Apple’s App Store.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Top Three Reasons To Build Your App For iPhone First: Reason 1</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So with all of this information, what should you build for first? For us, the answer is easy. If you’re launching an app for the first time, we recommend creating apps for Apple’s platform first. We’re not the only ones who think so too, as Instagram was released on the iPhone 18 months before Android. Most app developers tend to release their apps for the iPhone first before Android and it’s a trend that still continues today. &nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s a number of reasons why but the first reason to go Apple first is that more revenue is generated on Apple’s iOS platform than any other smartphone platform -including Android. This comes from app sales, in-app purchases and in-app advertising. There is a common belief amongst those in the industry that the reason for this is down to Apple and the iPhone being a premium brand. As a result, the average iPhone owner tends to be more affluent and able to spend more than their Android equivalent.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Top Three Reasons To Build Your App For iPhone First: Reason 2</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The second reason why we say go Apple first is because, as explained before, it’s a lot easier and less complex to create apps for Apple devices. They all standardised in some sort of way including the screen resolutions. Plus consumers trust Apple’s brand, and they have a strong loyalty to Apple’s lineup of iOS devices. The brand continually grows stronger with its cult-like following so if you can be sure that if your users love your on their iPhone, you’ll most likely see them download it on their iPad too, plus their next iPhone and the next iPad after that.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Top Three Reasons To Build Your App For iPhone First: Reason 3</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, the iPhone tends to just look and feel a bit slicker than the Android. The way users interact with the iPhone and apps plus their response back can really give your app the positive first impressions it needs to have people spread the word about it. But that’s a personal opinion! </p>\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>\n</div>        \n      "

    "content": "\n      \n        <div class=\"content-inner\">\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Top Four Secrets Of Successful Apps</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To kick start this series of blogs, we’re going to look at how to build a successful app. We’ve been in the app game for a number of years now and after seeing many apps that have achieved success and many that haven’t, we’ve narrowed it down to four things. Four things you need to seriously consider when it comes to building your app. We call these the four critical factors to success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also if you know anyone that wants to get started in app development, shoot them over this blog and let’s share the knowledge because I can’t stress how important and valuable what I’m about to tell you is.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Secret #1. High Usability</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The first critical factor on how to make a successful app is usability. Usability is all about how easy something is to use. <strong>Statistics have shown the average user takes fifty milliseconds to form an opinion about an app</strong>. Just to put that into perspective, it takes 50 milliseconds for us to form an option and around 300 milliseconds for us to blink! You’ve got to admit that’s pretty fast! Now this 50 milliseconds could yield a positive opinion which is great – but also a negative one if your audience finds your app difficult to navigate.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What can you do to make your app easy to use?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So what can you do to make your app easy to use? Firstly, do not take the usability app lightly. I know that sounds obvious after we just said it’s a critical factor but I’ve seen way too many times that people focus only on the looks and aesthetics of apps, and this isn’t a problem. However, it becomes a problem when almost no consideration is given to how easy the app is to use. A great UX designer can really help to make a successful app.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Secondly, make your app so it’s efficient. What I mean by this, is that your app serves a purpose to your audience right? This could be buying tickets for events, or messaging your friends etc. Whatever it is, <strong>try to make your app so that it can serve this purpose in the least amount of steps possible.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Companies have achieved massive success from this kind of efficiency. Look at Amazon for example. They’ve got this 1-click buy option on their product pages which really speeds up a user’s ordering process. It’s innovation like this that has led to its crazy growth over the last few few years, so don’t ignore it!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How To Make A Successful App Top Secret:</strong> Try To Make Your App So That It Can Serve Its Purpose In The Least Amount Of Steps Possible</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Thirdly, and this is some homework for you. Think of all the great apps you’ve used or your top three. What makes them your favourite apps? Nine times out of ten you’re going to find they’re in your top three because they’re easy to learn and importantly highly memorable. Make a list of them. In fact, draw out three columns on a page. In the first column, write the name of the app. The middle one, write what you like about using the app plus what you think makes it easy to use e.g. is it the fact that you have to swipe to do something instead of a button?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then in the final column, write how many steps it takes for the app to serve its purpose. When you’ve done this, you’ll start seeing some trends which will be invaluable. See how you can apply these trends to your app. It will super help in building your app and making sure it has a high level of usability.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Secret #2. Speed</strong><br></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The second critical factor on how to make a successful app is speed. Your app has to be fast!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to a recent study,<strong> 68% of users expect apps to load in six seconds or less. In fact, more than half of this 68% demand an app to load in less than three seconds. </strong>Now if your app fails to load within that time, it’s likely your consumers are going to abandon your app and possibly your brand altogether.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take a look at your favourite apps again. Time how long they take to load but also how fast they are once you start using them too. You probably haven’t run into any speed problems right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My favourite examples to tell clients about are Facebook and Instagram. Now I don’t have to tell you how many users they have but you can be pretty certain that most people you run into will use one of them, if not both. They load super fast and people use them on a daily basis. What this means is that overtime, we as a population have become accustomed to this speed. So it’s critical that your app is on that same level, if not better!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What can you do about your app’s speed?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, don’t take any shortcuts when it comes to making your app. We’ve seen a lot of people make their app using companies or freelancers online, which offer development at a super low cost. This can be really great in some situations, especially if you’re on a budget, but in an amount of time that is no way the time needed to create the functionality for that app. And usually when this happens, the app you’ve invested so much time and effort into runs slow. Then it all means for nothing when your consumers abandon it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ask some questions. Ask your development team, whether it’s us or someone else, what are they doing to make your app run fast? What steps have been taken to ensure the speed is at a high level? What steps are being taken to ensure that the app stays fast too, and not just on loading time upon first opening the app but also whilst using it too? See previous examples of their work and time it. I’ve included some really important questions that you can ask your app development team in our free App Starter Guide which you can get on <a href=\"https://www.appstarterguide.com\">www.appstarterguide.com</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Secret #3. Design</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The next critical factor on how to make a successful app is design. This is absolutely crucial to your app as first impressions count.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Did you know that it takes less than two-tenths of a second for a user to form a first opinion of your app’s design</strong>, a<strong>nd then another two and a half seconds in which that opinion is reinforced? </strong>That is one tight timeframe to make a first impression count in your favour! Knowing this, making a good first impression should be amongst one of your top priorities when building your app.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what can you do about this? Firstly, take your time with the design phase of your app. Don’t rush it. It can be exciting when you first see the designs to your app because it’s the time when you realise that your app idea is coming to life.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It all suddenly becomes very real that your idea is going to be a product. By all means enjoy it! But don’t let that excitement distract you from the task at hand. The aesthetics play a major role in your app and it’ll be your high attention to detail that will make sure your app looks great.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Secondly, whether it’s us or someone else producing your app, ask what the design process is. How will your idea be taken from your imagination to something on paper?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ask as many questions as you can about this process because you don’t want a company spending six months on development for your app, but then spending a couple of days on design. Now I’m not saying the design and development should take the same amount of time, but it should be treated with the same amount of dedication.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How To Make A Successful App Top Secret:</strong> Design And Development Should Be Treated With The Same Amount Of Dedication!</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of people ask our approach to app design and we take a slightly different approach to most development companies. You see, we work on one design concept for your app at a time rather than companies who will provide you with three or four at once. This enables us to fully invest our creative efforts on that one design rather than spending wasted time on multiple creative compositions that will not be used. We have found this process brings better value to you through saving time and resources. If you don’t like the initial design, our designer will create another one based on the new direction from you. Once a concept is approved, the remaining pages of your app will be designed out to be finalised and signed off by you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Have a look at your favourite apps!</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>And then thirdly, look at the apps you love to use and pay attention to the design. What do you love about them? What colours are being used? Are you seeing gradient colours or flat colours? I.e. a solid red background or a background that has light red fading to dark red from top to bottom. Little things like this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Write them down. Make a table like we did before, with three columns, except in the second column write what you like about the app and then in the third column write the year in which it was released. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now take this one step further and create this table again, except this time write a list of the top 10 apps in the App Store at the moment. Repeat the same process. This whole process will help you identify design trends that make the aesthetics of apps clean and modern that you like and those that are making apps right now successful.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>#4. Scalability</strong><br></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, and possibly the critical factor on how to make a successful app is scalability.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I always use an analogy to help explain this to our clients. Imagine you had the ability to build your dream house. But for the sake of argument, let’s say you had no idea how many bedrooms and bathrooms your dream house would have. What do you do? Well the first step in building a house would be to lay the foundations. But because you have no idea how many bedrooms and bathrooms you would need, you build a nice large foundation for your house to go on first and then start building up depending on what you need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you start building up with what you need now: a two bedroom house. One bedroom for yourself and your partner, and one guest bedroom. But then later you decide to have kids. This means you’ll need an extra room and more space. Now if you had built the foundations just for what you needed, it would be a problem to add the extra bedroom and space, right? You would have to extend that foundation, or worse yet, knock the whole house down and start again.&nbsp; This means you’ll have to invest more time and funds. But if you’ve already laid the nice large foundation as mentioned before, it would be simple and easy to just add some more rooms.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Building apps are the same!</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The correct foundations are needed for your app to be built so that it can easily adapt to increased demands. These increased demands could be an increase in users or the addition of more features. This makes sure that your app continues to run fast regardless of how many users are on it at the same time. Importantly, it prevents downtime on your app. The worst thing that could happen is that your app is built but only supports 100 users for example. But let’s say your app suddenly goes viral and then you have 10 million users. If your app can’t support this load, it would crash and then you lost out on current and potential new customers. IT’S NOT A GOOD LOOK AT ALL!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what can you do about this? Ask your app development team what steps are being taken to ensure the app is scalable e.g. ask whether your app will hold out at 10,000 million users and run the exact same as if it had 10 users? Don’t be afraid to ask these questions and make sure you get straight-forward answers that you understand. If you’re getting jargon thrown at you, then make sure you question it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">So there we have it!</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Those are my best and favourite tips on how to make a successful app. The four critical factors to success. Again I can’t stress enough how much I wish I knew these when I first started out. Because if you nail those four things, there is no reason why your app won’t be a success. Remember to shoot this over to a friend or family member who you think may get some value out of it.&nbsp;Use the critical factors to guide you when working with other <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.designrush.com/agency/mobile-app-design-development\" target=\"_blank\">Mobile App Design Companies</a>, <a href=\"https://topmarketingcompanies.com/digital-agencies/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Digital Agencies</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.ecommercecompanies.com/ecommerce-development-companies/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Software Development Companies.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ready to grow your business?
